# TA Application System

##What is our project?
Our project is a TA Application System with 2 modes - student mode and admin mode.
The signup, and login process for both the modes is the same.

##Student mode
Once you login through the student login, you will be taken to the profile page.
On this page you can can list your name, proficiencies/skills, undergrad status, etc.
You can either fill out the information, or come back to it later - and instead go to the course selection view.
In course selection view, you can add all the courses you are interested into your cart - and when you are done move to the cart view.
In cart view, you can remove courses from the cart and rank the courses you added previously to your cart.
You can always move between the 3 views, and log out at any time using the nav bar on the top-right hand corner.

##Admin mode
Once you login through the admin mode, you will be taken to the admin dashboard.
Here you can see all the courses in the database, start making offers to students, or consider the students for a course so you can look back at the page later.
You can also choose to filter the students based on their degree status, .

Besides the better UI and UX, filters for admins, and easier workflow, everything is lazy loaded and therefore is much more efficient compared to the current application system.
