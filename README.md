# TA Application System

A TA application and management system built in React, for the University of Toronto. 
This web app is a large step forward from the current system in use.

The app has two modes: student (allows students to give their information, choose which 
courses to apply for, rank course preferences, etc.) and admin (allows admins to view 
all applicants for courses, make offers to applicants, etc.). 

The app employs React for improved readability and reusability of code, leverages 
lazy-loading and other techniques to ensure an efficient and streamlined experience, 
robust authentication (with Passport.js), and a battle-tested database (PostgreSQL).

Below are a few example screenshots of some of the views in the web app. They serve
